# Delete one

## Problem Description
Given an integer array **A** of size **N.** You have to delete one element such that the GCD(Greatest common divisor) of the remaining array is maximum.

Find the maximum value of GCD.

## Problem Constraints
```
2 <=  N     <= 100000
1 <=  A[i]  <= 10^9
```

## Input Format
```
First argument is an integer array A.
```

## Output Format
```
Return an integer denoting the maximum value of GCD.
```
## Example
```
Input :
     A = [12, 15, 18]
     
Output :
    6
```

## Example Explanation
```
 If you delete 12, gcd will be 3.
 If you delete 15, gcd will be 6.
 If you delete 18, gcd will 3.
 Maximum vallue of gcd is 6.
```
