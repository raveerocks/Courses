## Problem Description

Given an integer array **A** of size **N**.
Find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed such that the GCD of the resulting array becomes 1.

If not possible then return -1.

## Problem Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
```

## Input Format
```
Input contains a single integer array A
```

## Output Format
```
Return an integer
```
## Example 
```
Input :
     A = [7, 2, 5]
     
Output :
    0
```

## Example Explanation
```
 GCD of the array A is 1.
 so, the number of elements to be removed is 0.
```
