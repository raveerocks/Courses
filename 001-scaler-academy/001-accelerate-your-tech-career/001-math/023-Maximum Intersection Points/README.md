# Maximum Intersection Points

## Problem Description
You are given **A** lines and **B** circles. Find the maximum number of intersection points that these **A** lines and **B** circles can have with each other.

## Problem Constraints
```
0 <= A,B <= 10000
```

## Input Format
```
First argument is an integer A denoting the number of lines.
Second argument is an integer B denoting the number of circles.
```

## Output Format
```
Return an integer denoting the maximum number of intersection points.
```
## Example
```
Input :
  A = 2
  B = 2

Output 1:
  11
```

## Example Explanation
```
Two circles can intersect at 2 points.
Two lines can intersect at only 1 point.
Two lines and two circles can intersect at 8 points.
So, total maximum number of intersection points are 11.
